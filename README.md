# MN Elections Data Play

This repository exists as storage for my experimentation with Minnesota local and statewide elections data, both in cleaning / scraping the data and in visualizing it with `sf` and `ggplot`.

### State Legislative Districts and Elections:

Historic statewide elections found on the [MN Elections Archive](https://mn.electionarchives.lib.umn.edu) \(curated by [Eric Ostermeier](https://smartpolitics.lib.umn.edu)\).

### County Commissioner Districts and Elections:

Recent elections and GIS data downloaded locally from the MN Secretary of State's [results page](https://www.sos.state.mn.us/elections-voting/election-results) and modified extensively. Historic local GIS data from 1992-2001 combined from various sources, including the MNHS Governor Ventura redistricting [archive](http://www2.mnhs.org/library/findaids/gr00558.xml) and MN SoS precinct results [spreadsheets](https://www.sos.state.mn.us/elections-voting/election-results/2000/2000-general-election-results/2000-precinct-results-spreadsheet/).
