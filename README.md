# MN Elections Data Play

This repository exists as storage for my experimentation with Minnesota local and statewide elections data, both in cleaning / scraping the data and in visualizing it with `ggplot`.

Recent local and statewide data downloaded locally from the MN Secretary of State's [results page](https://www.sos.state.mn.us/elections-voting/election-results) and modified extensively. Historic local data to be scraped from various other sources. Historic statewide data found on the [MN Elections Archive](https://mn.electionarchives.lib.umn.edu) \(curated by [Eric Ostermeier](https://smartpolitics.lib.umn.edu)\).
