      <td class="left"> Lineage  </td>
      <td colspan="4" class="right"> The original 1990 School District file delineation work was done at LMIC (the Land Management Information Center, now MnGeo) on contract to the U.S. Census Bureau. The Census Bureau was under contract to the U.S. Department of Education to create a nationwide school district file and population totals that matched the 1990 Census boundaries. LMIC provided delineations of the school district boundaries to the Census Bureau, based on map information provided by the County Auditor's offices to LMIC. The Census Bureau did the automation of the 1990 file. <br> <br>Subsequent annual updates have been made to the file to reflect boundary changes, boundary corrections, and school district consolidations. Beginning in 1998, school attendance area boundaries were added. These updates have been done by the Minnesota Legislative Coordinating Commission GIS Office (LCC), LMIC, and the Office of the Secretary of State, with assistance from the Minnesota Department of Education (formerly MN Dept. of Children, Families, and Learning). <br> <br>The steps used to create the original 1990 file, and subsequent updates to 1999, are outlined below. <br> <br>CREATION OF THE ORIGINAL 1990 SCHOOL DISTRICT BOUNDARY FILE: <br> <br>1. Delineation of school district boundaries (LMIC): <br> <br>LMIC's role was to delineate school district boundaries to match Census county, minor civil division (MCD), tract, and block boundaries. LMIC received a set of large-scale (approx 1:800) maps of census boundaries from the Census Bureau. These census boundary maps included MCD, tract, and block boundaries.  <br> <br>LMIC obtained school district boundary maps from the auditor's office in each county.  LMIC sent blank Minnesota Department of Transportation County Highway Maps to each County Auditor and received back those maps with the school districts delineated on them. The Auditors' Offices drew the boundaries according to their official records. LMIC still has these maps on file.  <br> <br>Using the County Auditors' delineation maps, LMIC transferred  the school district boundaries onto the 1:800 Census maps.  The Census had very specific guidelines, which they enforced. Delineations were to match to within 1/16 of an inch - basically, a fine pencil-width. <br> <br>2. Automation of School District Boundary Linework: <br> <br>The Census Bureau did the automation of the maps to create the digital file. This was done in two steps: <br> <br>1. Wherever the linework matched the Census tract, block, MCD, etc., boundaries, exactly, the census units were assigned a school district code via a lookup table. <br> <br>2. Where the school district boundaries did NOT follow the Census boundaries, then the Census Bureau digitized the necessary linework.  These base maps for automation eventually came back to the state, and are stored in the State Demographic Center files. <br> <br>3. Population totals (LMIC): <br> <br>Where the school district boundaries did not match the Census boundaries, LMIC also provided population figures to apportion the Census unit population into the school districts. Rather than apportioning population strictly on the basis of area, this was done through examination of other maps, sometimes, as in the metro area, by counting the houses on aerial photos.  The demographic distribution by school district was important as a basis for funding. <br> <br>4. File distribution (Census Bureau): <br> <br>In 1992, the automated 1990 School District Boundary files were delivered by the Census Bureau to the Legislative Coordinating Commission GIS Office (LCC) in TIGER/Line format. LCC extracted the data from the TIGER format and created an ARC coverage, which was then provided to LMIC and other agencies. LMIC did not receive the digital files back from the Census Bureau for any type of review or verification. Errors in the school district boundary file were reported to the LCC and the Secretary of State's Office. These errors were corrected  on the final file. Many of the errors relate to the Census boundary alignment problem - i.e., school district boundary lines were moved to coincide with the appropriate Census boundary. <br> <br>NOTES ON MISMATCHES OF DATA: <br> <br>1. The County Auditor's Office is required to delineate school district boundaries by law, and maintains the official record for tax purposes. It must be noted that the school districts also have boundary maps, and that, while the two sets of map boundaries should match, they do not always do so.  In cases where the school district and the county auditor records show different boundaries, this should be resolved locally. It becomes an issue for the maintainers of statewide files when updates are obtained from both sources. <br> <br>2. Mismatches between the Census Boundary lines and the School District lines: although the school district boundary file generally matches Census lines, it does not always do so. Therefore, mismatches can be legitimate, based upon the original maps from the County Auditors' Offices, and can be verified against the maps on file at LMIC and the State Demographic Center. <br> <br>ANNUAL UPDATES AFTER 1990: <br> <br>1. (1992-1996) The LCC made updates to the file as needed, based on boundary changes, boundary corrections, and school district consolidations. Information on necessary updates was forwarded to LCC by the Secretary of State's Office or the Department of Education (formerly the Minnesota Department of Children, Families, and Learning). Most updates to the files involved school district consolidations.  LCC did updates for the years 1992 through 1996. <br> <br>2. (1997) LMIC obtained the 1996 School District boundary file from the LCC. This file was updated with coding changes and consolidation information for SY1997.  As part of a project for the Minnesota Department of Education, LMIC added school attendance area boundaries to the file. <br> <br>3. (1998-2005) LMIC maintained this file on a yearly basis while adding and changing attendance boundaries based on revisions sent from the school districts to LMIC. Beginning in 1998, LMIC received attendance area boundary information for all 345+ school districts. <br> <br>4. (2006)  MDE brought the school district files into a Personal GeoDatabase (PGD). Also included were attendance boundaries and school locations, both public and non-public. <br> <br>5. (2007) Minor modifications made to attendance boundaries. Two new districts were developed through consolidations. 2902 from Russell, Tyler and Ruthton and 2899 from Plainview and Elgin-Millville. <br> <br>6. (2008) Minor modifications made to attendance boundaries.   County parcel data used to update district boundaries. <br> <br>7. (2009) Minor modifications made to attendance and some district boundaries. County parcel data used to update district boundaries. <br> <br>8. (2010)  County parcel data used to update district boundaries. There are 337 school districts. <br> <br>Counties where parcel data was used to update district boundaries: <br> <br>1. Aitkin <br>2. Anoka <br>3. Becker <br>4. Beltrami <br>5. Benton <br>6. Brown <br>7. Carlton <br>8. Carver <br>9. Cass <br>10. Chisago <br>11. Clay <br>12. Clearwater <br>13. Cook <br>14. Crow Wing <br>15.
