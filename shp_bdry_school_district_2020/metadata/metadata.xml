Minnesota school districts report any changes to their elementary, middle and high school attendance area boundaries annually. This school district file was dissolved from the statewide attendance boundary file to show just the statewide school district boundaries.  Since 2008, district boundaries have been modified based on county parcels. (Parcel data are supplied by counties to MnGeo, who in turn share that with MDE.)

NOTES ON MISMATCHES OF DATA:

1. The County Auditor's Office is required to delineate school district boundaries by law, and maintains the official record for tax purposes. Note that school districts also have boundary maps, and that, while the two sets of map boundaries should match, they do not always. In cases where the school district and the county auditor records show different boundaries, this should be resolved locally first before suggesting updates to MDE. It becomes an issue for the maintainers of statewide files when updates are obtained from both sources.

2. Mismatches between the Census Boundary lines and the School District lines: although the school district boundary file generally uses Census geography where possible, it does not always follow precisely. Therefore, mismatches between this file and school district boundaries maintained by the Census can be legitimate. As of 2019, MDE is updating Census versions via the Census School District Reporting Program (SDRP). However, due to the limitations of this program, there will always be mismatches, particularly along detailed borders such as those defined by water bodies.

For 2020, the SDORGID column was added for transparency on unique identifier linkage to the MDE ORG database. ORGID was also added for consistency with related datasets.</procdesc><proccont><cntinfo><cntperp><cntper>Scott Freburg</cntper><cntorg>Land Management Information Center</cntorg></cntperp><cntpos>Senior GIS Specialist</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing address</addrtype><address>658 Cedar Street</address><city>St. Paul</city><state>MN</state><postal>55155</postal><country>USA</country></cntaddr><cntvoice>651-201-2485</cntvoice><cntemail>scott.freburg@state.mn.us</cntemail><hours>0700 - 1530</hours></cntinfo></proccont><procsv>ArcMAP 9.1</procsv><procdate>May 2008</procdate><proctime>3 months</proctime></procstep></lineage></dataqual><spdoinfo><direct>Vector</direct><mgmg3obj>Polygon</mgmg3obj><mgmg3til>State</mgmg3til><ptvctinf><esriterm Name="sd2011"><efeatyp Sync="TRUE">Simple</efeatyp><efeageom Sync="TRUE">Polygon</efeageom><esritopo Sync="TRUE">FALSE</esritopo><efeacnt Sync="TRUE">338</efeacnt><spindex Sync="TRUE">TRUE</spindex><linrefer Sync="TRUE">FALSE</linrefer></esriterm><sdtsterm Name="sd2011"><sdtstype Sync="TRUE">G-polygon</sdtstype><ptvctcnt Sync="TRUE">338</ptvctcnt></sdtsterm></ptvctinf></spdoinfo><spref><vertdef><altsys><altdatum>not applicable</altdatum></altsys><depthsys><depthdn>not applicable</depthdn></depthsys></vertdef><horizsys><planar><gridsys><gridsysn>Universal Transverse Mercator</gridsysn><utm><utmzone>15</utmzone></utm></gridsys><planci><plandu>meters</plandu></planci></planar><geodetic><horizdn>NAD83</horizdn><ellips>GRS80</ellips></geodetic></horizsys></spref><eainfo><overview><eaover>SDORGID (19,0,DOUBLE)

Detailed overview of columns:
SDORGID - unique numeric identifier used to link with the MDE ORG database.

ORGID - This is a concatenated character field containing UNI_TYP, UNI_MAJ and 6 following 0's, which can be used to identify school districts.
  Example: Aitkin is 010001000000 (01 0001 000 000).
  Example:  Brandon-Evansville is 012908000000 (01 2908 000 000).

UNI_TYP - This is an MDE two character identifier describing the type of school district
  "01" - Independent Districts and Schools
  "02" - Common Districts and Schools: Franconia-0323, Prinsburg-0815
  "03" - Special Districts and Schools: Minneapolis-0001, South St. Paul-0006

UNI_MAJ - Four-character school district number, left-padded with zeroes.
   0001 (Aitkin) to 2908 (Brandon-Evansville)

UNI_NAM - "preferred name" of the School District from the MDE ORG database. Prior publications of this data used a simplified name.

WEB_URL - School district website, where available, from the MDE ORG database.

SQMILES - Square miles for each district, derived from the shape of the polygon.

ACRES - Acres for each district, derived from the shape of the polygon.</eaover><eadetcit>More current information on school districts can be obtained from MDE ORG at https://public.education.mn.gov/MdeOrgView/</eadetcit></overview></eainfo><distinfo><resdesc>School district boundaries 2019-2020</resdesc><distliab>The Minnesota Department of Education (MDE) does not warrant the results you may obtain by using this dataset.
